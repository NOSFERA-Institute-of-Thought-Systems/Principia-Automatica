## Abstract

*We present libCognito, a high-performance C++ engine with WebAssembly bindings, designed as the foundational computational backend for the NÅŒSFERA cognitive OS. The engine's core module implements a spectral analysis pipeline, constructing a Hamiltonian matrix from semantic vector embeddings and solving for its principal eigenvector via a numerically robust power iteration method. We detail the critical design decisions, including the choice of the Eigen library for linear algebra, and the resolution of cross-language development challenges such as memory layout mismatches (Row-Major vs. Column-Major) and toolchain configuration for modern Emscripten. We demonstrate through a live benchmark that the engine is capable of performing complex linear algebra operations on the client-side, providing a definitive proof-of-concept for computationally intensive, browser-based agentic AI systems.*

## 1. Introduction

*   **Problem:** Modern AI is often reliant on cloud-based, high-latency server infrastructure. Can we build a powerful, interactive AI system that runs entirely on the client's device?
*   **Thesis:** By leveraging C++ compiled to WebAssembly, we can create a performant backend capable of the sophisticated linear algebra required for geometric and spectral AI models, directly within a web browser.
*   **Contribution:** This paper documents the design and implementation of `libCognito`, the engine that proves this thesis.

## 2. System Architecture & Design

### 2.1 Core Technologies
*   C++17 for performance and control.
*   The Eigen C++ library for linear algebra.
*   Emscripten for compilation to WebAssembly.
*   CMake for build system management.

### 2.2 The C++/JavaScript Bridge
*   Explanation of the `emscripten::bind` system.
*   Discussion of the final API contract (passing typed arrays directly vs. manual memory management).

## 3. The Spectral Engine: Implementation Details

### 3.1 Hamiltonian Construction
*   The mathematical formula for cosine similarity.
*   The critical bug and solution: Handling zero-vectors with a `safe_normalize` function to prevent `NaN` corruption.

### 3.2 Power Iteration Eigensolver
*   The algorithm for power iteration.
*   The critical bug and solution: The epsilon guard to prevent division-by-zero during normalization.

### 3.3 The Memory Layout Challenge
*   The most important discovery of the sprint.
*   Explanation of Row-Major (JavaScript) vs. Column-Major (Eigen default) memory.
*   The definitive solution: Using `Eigen::Matrix<..., Eigen::RowMajor>` to ensure correct data interpretation.

## 4. Results: A Validation Benchmark

*   **Setup:** Describe the mock data (the 5 paper vectors).
*   **Execution:** Show the final, clean console log from the instrumented C++ core.
*   **Analysis:** Explain why the resulting eigenvector `[0, -0.554..., ...]` is the correct and meaningful output.

## 5. Conclusion

*   `libCognito` successfully solves the challenge of high-performance, client-side computation.
*   The lessons learned (especially regarding memory layout and numerical stability) are critical for future development.
*   This engine now serves as the proven foundation for the subsequent layers of the Promethean Engine.
