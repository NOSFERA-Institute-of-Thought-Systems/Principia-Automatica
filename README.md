# Principia Automatica: A 25-Paper Roadmap to Embodied Superintelligence

This repository contains the complete research, theoretical blueprints, and documentation for the Principia Automatica research program. This is the intellectual foundation for the NŌSFERA cognitive OS and its subsequent applications.

## Core Philosophy

*Intelligence is not a monolithic black box; it is a hierarchical, physically-grounded process of invariant discovery and recursive self-improvement. We will build it from first principles.*

---

## The Roadmap

This research is structured as a multi-part journey, culminating in the creation of a general, autonomous, and self-improving intelligence.

### Part 1: The Foundational Toolkit - Forging the Tools of Thought (Papers 1-5)
*   **Goal:** To build the core theoretical and computational instruments required for all future work.
*   **Status:** [IN PROGRESS | PLANNED | COMPLETE]

### The NŌSFERA Codex

The operational blueprint for the implementation of these theories is detailed in the [NŌSFERA Codex](NOSFERA_Codex.md). This document defines the data schemas, API contracts, and design language for the cognitive OS that serves as the "body" for this research.
