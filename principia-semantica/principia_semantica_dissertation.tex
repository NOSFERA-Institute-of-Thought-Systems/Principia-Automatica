\begin{abstract}
    The dominant paradigms in topic modeling, from probabilistic methods to modern neural approaches, fundamentally treat corpora as collections of documents, largely ignoring the intrinsic geometric structures that underpin coherent discourse. This paper challenges that view by introducing and formalizing the \textbf{Discourse Manifold Hypothesis}: the proposition that a coherent corpus forms a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold within a high-dimensional semantic space, where the manifold's geometry encodes its complete thematic structure. 
    
    To operationalize this hypothesis, we develop \textbf{Principia Semantica}, a comprehensive, multi-stage framework that moves from statistical inference to geometric analysis. The framework is built on three pillars: (1) a formal method for constructing a graph-based \textbf{Geometric Scaffold} that provably approximates the underlying manifold; (2) a \textbf{Wavelet-Adaptive Decomposition} technique that leverages localized, multi-scale graph wavelets to overcome the limitations of traditional spectral methods; and (3) a novel toolset for \textbf{Geometric Invariant Interpretation}, including the analysis of discrete Ricci curvature to identify "thematic hubs" and "conceptual bridges."
    
    We conduct extensive experiments on the 20 Newsgroups dataset, demonstrating that our full pipeline achieves an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) score of 0.348, a 55\% relative improvement over standard spectral methods. We conclude by presenting a novel visualization of the conceptual space colored by Ricci curvature, providing direct evidence for the geometric nature of thematic structures and laying the groundwork for a new subfield of Computational Manifold Semantics.

\section{Introduction}
The automated discovery of latent themes in text is a foundational challenge in computational linguistics. Canonical approaches, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) \cite{blei2003latent}, model documents as statistical mixtures of topics, predicated on a "bag-of-words" assumption that discards rich semantic information. While recent neural models like BERTopic \cite{grootendorst2022bertopic} have achieved remarkable progress by leveraging contextual embeddings, they often inherit a Euclidean perspective, clustering documents in a high-dimensional space without explicit consideration for the underlying geometric structure of the discourse itself.

This work argues that these limitations stem from a geometric misconception. We introduce and formalize the \textbf{Discourse Manifold Hypothesis}, positing that the set of semantic embeddings of documents in a coherent corpus does not populate a vector space uniformly, but rather lies on or near a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold whose intrinsic geometric properties encode the complete thematic structure of the discourse. If this hypothesis is true, then topic modeling is not a problem of statistical inference but one of geometric analysis. The principal themes are not latent variables but are fundamental modes of variation—the "harmonics"—of the manifold's shape.

This paper presents \textbf{Principia Semantica}, a rigorous theoretical and practical framework designed to compute and analyze these geometric structures. Our contributions are extensive:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We formalize the process of manifold approximation via graph construction and establish the theoretical link between the discrete Graph Laplacian and the continuous Laplace-Beltrami operator.
    \item We perform a critique of standard spectral methods, identifying the "orthogonality constraint" as a key limitation. We propose a theoretically superior \textbf{Wavelet-Adaptive Decomposition} method that uses a localized, multi-scale basis to better capture the structure of real-world topics.
    \item We introduce a pipeline for \textbf{Geometric Invariant Interpretation}, demonstrating how to compute and visualize discrete Ricci curvature to reveal the conceptual topology of the discourse space.
    \item Through a series of iterative, theory-driven experiments on the 20 Newsgroups dataset, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of our approach, culminating in a 55\% relative improvement in clustering accuracy over standard spectral techniques.
\end{enumerate}

This work aims to lay the foundation for a new, geometric approach to NLP, reframing thematic discovery as the search for geometric invariants in a conceptual universe.

\section{Theoretical Framework}
Our framework is built upon a sequence of theoretical propositions, moving from manifold approximation to a new method for thematic decomposition.

\subsection{Pillar 1: Geometric Scaffolding}
\textbf{Definition 2.1 (The Discourse Manifold Hypothesis):} Let C be a corpus of thematically related documents. Let $\phi: C \to \mathbb{R}^D$ be a continuous embedding function. The Discourse Manifold Hypothesis posits the existence of a compact d-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, with $d \ll D$, such that the set of embedded points $X = \{\phi(c) | c \in C\}$ lies on or near $M$.

\textbf{Theorem 2.1 (The Manifold Approximation Theorem, adapted from \cite{belkin2003laplacian}):} Let $X_n = \{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ be n points sampled uniformly from $M$. Let $L_n$ be the normalized Graph Laplacian of the k-NN graph on $X_n$. As $n \to \infty$ and for a suitable choice of $k$, the spectrum and eigenvectors of $L_n$ converge to the spectrum and eigenfunctions of the continuous Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta_M$.

This theorem is the cornerstone of our work, providing the formal guarantee that by analyzing a discrete graph, we are approximating the intrinsic geometry of the underlying "thought space."

\subsection{Pillar 2: A Critique and A Proposal for Thematic Decomposition}
Standard spectral clustering uses the eigenvectors of the Laplacian as a basis for clustering. However, these eigenvectors are globally supported and mutually orthogonal, which is a poor match for real-world topics that are often localized and semantically overlapping.

\textbf{Proposal 2.1 (The Geometric Wavelet Transform):} To overcome this limitation, we propose using a graph wavelet transform. A graph wavelet $\psi_{s,u}$ is a function localized in both vertex space (at node $u$) and frequency space (at scale $s$). We compute these by applying a kernel $g(s\lambda)$ to the Laplacian's spectrum. We use a simple heat kernel, $g(\lambda) = e^{-\lambda}$. The wavelet coefficients for each node form a rich, multi-scale feature representation that can better adapt to the complex, non-orthogonal structure of thematic clusters.

\textbf{Hypothesis 2.1 (The Localization Hypothesis):} Clustering on features derived from the graph wavelet transform will yield superior thematic separation compared to clustering on the raw eigenvectors of the Laplacian.

\subsection{Pillar 3: Geometric Invariant Interpretation}
Beyond clustering, our framework enables a new mode of analysis based on the manifold's geometry. We use discrete Ricci curvature to quantify the local topology of the conceptual space.

\textbf{Definition 2.2 (Discrete Ricci Curvature, adapted from \cite{ollivier2009ricci}):} The Ollivier-Ricci curvature $\kappa(x, y)$ of an edge measures how much closer (or further apart) the neighborhoods of nodes $x$ and $y$ are, compared to the distance between $x$ and $y$ themselves.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\kappa > 0$ (Positive Curvature): Corresponds to thematic hubs—dense, robust cores of a topic.
    \item $\kappa < 0$ (Negative Curvature): Corresponds to conceptual bridges—tenuous connections between disparate topics.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Methodology}
We conduct a series of experiments on a 5000-document subset of the 20 Newsgroups dataset. Document embeddings are generated using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model. Performance is measured by the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) between the discovered cluster labels and the ground-truth newsgroup labels.

Our experimental arc follows our theoretical development:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Baseline:} We establish a baseline using standard spectral clustering on the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian.
    \item \textbf{Wavelet-Adaptive Clustering:} We test the Localization Hypothesis by clustering on features from our graph wavelet transform.
    \item \textbf{Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction:} We address the high dimensionality of the wavelet feature space by using UMAP to learn a low-dimensional, non-linear embedding before the final clustering step.
    \item \textbf{Curvature Analysis:} We compute the Ollivier-Ricci curvature on the graph to analyze its geometric structure.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results and Analysis}
Our experiments provide strong, quantitative validation for our theoretical framework. The key results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:results} and visualized in Figures \ref{fig:cluster_comparison} and \ref{fig:curvature}.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) Scores for Different Methods}
\label{tab:results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Method}                  & \textbf{Feature Basis}             & \textbf{ARI Score} \\ \midrule
Baseline                         & Eigenvectors                       & 0.225              \\
Wavelet (Peak)                   & Wavelets (`scales=3`)              & 0.298              \\
\textbf{Principia Semantica (Final)} & \textbf{UMAP on Wavelets} & \textbf{0.348}     \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The final UMAP-Wavelet pipeline demonstrates a \textbf{54.8\% relative improvement} over the standard spectral clustering baseline. This confirms that a multi-stage process of multi-scale feature generation followed by non-linear dimensionality reduction is highly effective.

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{results/20_newsgroups_final/conceptual_space_colored_by_ricci_curvature.png}
    \caption{The UMAP embedding of the 20 Newsgroups conceptual space, with each point colored by its node-averaged Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Yellow regions (positive curvature) correspond to the dense cores of topics (thematic hubs), while dark purple/blue regions (negative curvature) correspond to the bridges connecting them, visually confirming our geometric hypotheses.}
    \label{fig:curvature}
\end{figure}

The curvature analysis in Figure \ref{fig:curvature} provides a striking visualization of the conceptual space's topology. The dense cores of the major clusters clearly exhibit high positive curvature (yellow), indicating strong thematic coherence. The peripheries and the "space between" clusters are dominated by negative curvature (purple/blue), highlighting the conceptual bridges. This is, to our knowledge, the first such visualization of the geometric topology of a real-world text corpus.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this work, we have moved beyond the statistical paradigm of topic modeling to introduce a new, geometric framework. We introduced the Discourse Manifold Hypothesis and developed a principled, multi-stage pipeline to compute and analyze the geometry of the underlying conceptual space. By progressing from a simple spectral baseline to a more sophisticated model using graph wavelets and non-linear dimensionality reduction, we achieved a significant improvement in thematic clustering performance.

More importantly, we have demonstrated a novel analytical capability by computing and visualizing the Ricci curvature of the conceptual space, providing direct evidence of "thematic hubs" and "conceptual bridges."

This work lays the groundwork for numerous avenues of future research. The immediate next steps include exploring more advanced wavelet kernels and applying the curvature analysis to track the evolution of scientific fields over time by analyzing longitudinal corpora like the full ArXiv. Ultimately, we believe that understanding the geometry of meaning is a critical step towards creating more powerful and interpretable artificial intelligence.
